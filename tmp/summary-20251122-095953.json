  "summary": "Fixed database crash issue by creating a comprehensive database repair and normalization system. Created repairDatabase.ts script that removes duplicates, normalizes data structure (removes 'quote' field, ensures 'title' exists), and standardizes category names. Enhanced addCandidate function with validation, duplicate prevention, and data sanitization. Created API route /api/candidates for safe candidate addition with proper error handling. Updated package.json with repair-db script. All changes maintain backward compatibility with frontend. The repair script can be run with 'npm run repair-db' to clean up the database and prevent future crashes.",
  "current_status": "Database repair system is complete and ready to use. The repair script will clean duplicates, normalize data structure, and validate all candidates. Enhanced addCandidate function now prevents duplicate entries and validates all data before insertion. API route is available for safe candidate addition. Frontend is compatible with normalized data structure. Next step: Run 'npm run repair-db' to repair the existing database, then test adding new candidates using the API route."
