  "summary": "Fixed multiple console errors and warnings from the production deployment. Updated CSP to allow WebSocket connections (wss://) for Firebase Realtime Database and added frame-src directive for Vercel Live feedback iframe. Created image path normalization utility to handle spaces and special characters in image filenames, ensuring paths match actual file names in public/dancers directory. Added null checks for candidate.name in filter functions to prevent 'toLowerCase' errors when candidate data is undefined. Updated ImageWithFallback component and classement page to use normalized image paths. All fixes are complete and ready for deployment.",
  "current_status": "All critical console errors have been addressed. CSP now properly allows Firebase WebSocket connections and Vercel Live iframes.
