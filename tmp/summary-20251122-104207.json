  "summary": "Removed all static candidate data from the frontend and updated all pages to load candidates exclusively from Firebase backend. Removed staticCandidates array from app/page.tsx, staticAllCandidates and oldStaticCandidates from app/candidats/page.tsx, and staticRankedCandidates from app/classement/page.tsx. Updated all three pages to use only Firebase candidates with no fallback to static data. Added empty state UI components that display loading spinners while data is being fetched and informative messages when no candidates are available from the backend. All pages now show empty states when backend data is not available, ensuring the frontend is completely dependent on backend data.",
  "current_status": "All static candidate data has been removed from the frontend. Pages now load candidates exclusively from Firebase backend. Empty states are implemented for loading and no-data scenarios. The application is ready for deployment with backend-only data loading."
